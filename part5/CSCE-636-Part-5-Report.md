## 1. Research Topic

**Smart Home** now has become a very popular topic recently. And deep learning techniques are also widely applied in this field for different sorts of video classification tasks. 

For this project, I am trying to design a kind of "smart home", where we can use cameras to observe whether an old person living there is slipping or fainting so that we can decide whether to call someone to help the slipped/fainted person and prevent some bad things happened in advance.

So the main topic and challenge of this project mainly focus on how to detect the person living in our house is slipping or fainting. And I implemented a model for detecting "slipping" or "fainting" actions using a recurrent convolutional neural network architecture (CNN + LSTM). 

## 2. Method

Since videos can be considered as a series of frames of images and CNN models are very common to be used in image classification, intuitively I would tend to use CNN to extract the spatial features of each video frame, and then feed them to the LSTM network to obtain sequence timing features.
